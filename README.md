Unified farm management platform for crop and poultry operations built with Budibase
# AgriSphere — Unified Farm Management Platform

## Project Overview
**AgriSphere** is a unified farm management platform designed to centralize crop and poultry operations for a mid-sized agricultural business in Germany.

The platform replaces fragmented manual logs and spreadsheets with a single digital system that enables real-time tracking, analytics, automation, and regulatory compliance.

This repository serves as a **project management and product delivery case study**, demonstrating structured PM execution using agile principles and low-code development via Budibase.
